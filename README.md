# Description

<<<<<<< HEAD
Tasky is a simple task manager based on tagging. The interface is very reactive
and straightforward. Tagging makes task filtering super easy. Tasky can be
installed on your own server or on your desktop. You decide the way you want to
use it!

# Install

    npm install cozy-tasky -g
=======
Tasky is a simple yet powerful task manager. I found the usual tree structure to organize tasks far too rigid, so I came up with the idea that you can build your own tree on the fly with tags.

**DISCLAMER**
Windows users, the build system assume that you can run the following UNIX commands:
